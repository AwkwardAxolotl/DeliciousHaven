    "Add cream, ham, rosemary, freshly ground black pepper, and cayenne. Stir in a splash of water, and bring mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in peas, taste, and adjust seasoning. Remove from heat and let cool. Refrigerate until needed.",

    "Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, and the sauce is bubbling out of the hole in the center, about 1 hour.",
    "Serve hot, eaten with a spoon from the ramekin, or let cool to warm, and remove whole pot pie from ramekin, to eat with your hands. These are also great eaten at room temperature or cold."

Use a rolling pin to roll out nice and thin, about 1/8 inch or less. It's ok if the naan is not a perfect circle. You will need extra flour for rolling out as the dough is sticky, but try to use as little as possible.",
    "Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Transfer dough circles into the hot dry skillet and cook until little bubbles form on the surface and the underside is lightly browned, about 1 minute. Flip naan over and cook for 1 more minute. Press down slightly with a spatula to increase the heat during cooking. Flip over twice more and cook for an additional 15 seconds per side, but make sure not to overcook to preserve the texture. Naan should still be flexible when you remove it from the skillet onto a plate.",
    "Cover with a kitchen towel to keep warm and moist while you cook the other naan breads. Stack all 6 naan breads on top of each other and keep covered with a kitchen towel.",
    "When you are finished cooking all 6 naan breads, unstack breads and brush the first naan bread on both sides with a little bit of melted butter. Stack second piece of naan on top and only brush the top side. Keep stacking and buttering all the naan breads. Fold each naan into a triangle and serve."

    "To prepare the sauce: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in garlic and pesto sauce and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in heavy cream; increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk in Parmesan cheese until melted.

Transfer dough circles into the hot dry skillet and cook until little bubbles form on the surface and the underside is lightly browned, about 1 minute. Flip naan over and cook for 1 more minute. Press down slightly with a spatula to increase the heat during cooking. Flip over twice more and cook for an additional 15 seconds per side, but make sure not to overcook to preserve the texture. Naan should still be flexible when you remove it from the skillet onto a plate.",

    "When you are finished cooking all 6 naan breads, unstack breads and brush the first naan bread on both sides with a little bit of melted butter. Stack second piece of naan on top and only brush the top side. Keep stacking and buttering all the naan breads. Fold each naan into a triangle and serve."
